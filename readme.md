# marbastlib
A library collecting MX and Choc style footprints, as well as various other parts used to design custom keyboards. It is maintained by [ebastler](https://github.com/ebastler/) and [MarvFPV](https://github.com/marvfpv). Huge thanks to all of our users who test new footprints and notify us about bugs or issues and of course to our [awesome contributors](https://github.com/ebastler/marbastlib/graphs/contributors) who commit components of their own!

The current latest release is made in/for KiCad 8.0 stable version. Older releases are still offered for KiCad 7.0 stable versions by the PCM but may lack components and/or bugfixes as no features or fixes are being backported. Older KiCad versions are no longer supported by the main branch, please refer to one of the v6 branches for KiCad 6.x, and my (significantly smaller) [legacy lib](https://github.com/ebastler/KiCad-keyboard-parts.pretty) for KiCad 5.x.

We try to offer 3D models for as many footprints in this library as possible, creating our own models where none exist. All components for which we have models available have them linked into the footprint - the PCM version will automatically download everything in the right file paths.

## Disclaimer

### **We do not assume any responsibility for broken PCBs or damages derived from errors in this library. Use at your own risk, and please open an issue or pull-request if you encounter any errors.**

Please do not use any footprint from this library with a symbol from another library (or the other way round). Pin numbering conventions are not always the same, and unless you check very carefully this can lead to broken PCBs.

## How to install
Open the KiCad "Plugin and Content Manager" (referred to as "PCM" from now on) and click on "Manage". Add a new entry with the plus sign and paste 

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebastler/ebastler-KiCad-repository/main/repository.json
```

From this point on you will have "ebastler KiCad repository" in your drop-down selection, and it will allow you to install (and update) marbastlib through PCM - easy and hassle-free.

## Footprint libs
Unlike previous versions of marbastlib, were `main`, `untested` and `specialty` were separate libraries, now all footprints were merged into a single repository, but separate libraries. `marbastlib-choc` (to pick one example) is the new equivalent to `main`/`stable`, while `marbastlib-xp-choc` ("xp" stands for "experimental", but also makes sure the xp libs end up on the bottom of the list) join `specialty` and `untested` into one library. Please use anything in a "xp" library with special care, and report back to us once a footprint in such a lib has been successfully tested, so it can be moved into the regular libs.

These footprints use some (rather cryptic) naming schemes to differentiate various sub-models with small differences. Here's the naming scheme. `A`: for controllers with more (optional) pins than Pro Micro, all have been used. `C`: for controllers with castellated pads, these footprints support castellated. `H`: these footprints offer through-hole pads. `USBup`: these footprints are designed to be used with the USB port facing away from the PCB. `USBdown`: these footprints are designed to be used with the USB port sandwiched between controller and PCB. `Reversible`: These footprints have mask openings and alignment helps on both sides of the PCB.

## 3D Models
Many of these were provided by someone else. I do not hold any rights for those and owe the original designers big thanks. These models are NOT covered by the license applied to the rest of the repo. If no source is provided, I designed the model myself, using datasheet specs as far as possible. These models are covered by the repository license. If your file is in this repo and you would like it gone, please contact me. I included them to make it easier to use the models directly from the library, but will respect the original designer's/copyright holder's wishes.
